**Usage:** "The agent uses an Emotional Reasoning Chain to ensure responses are psychologically attuned."

---

### Meta-Framework
**Definition:** The universal cycle that integrates all Creative Acceleration Lab methodologies.

**Cycle:** Emotion → Story → Symbol → Prototype → Expression

**Usage:** "Every project flows through the Meta-Framework, ensuring emotional and technical alignment."

---

### Anti-Bureaucracy
**Definition:** A philosophy and practice of eliminating unnecessary processes, approvals, and complexity in favor of speed and clarity.

**Principles:**
- No meetings > 25 minutes
- No documents > 1 page during prototyping
- No complex estimations
- Build to learn, not to satisfy process

**Usage:** "Our anti-bureaucracy approach means we ship daily and kill unnecessary meetings."

---

### Speed Studio
**Definition:** The service pillar focused on fast prototyping, AI feature delivery, and acceleration.

**Core Services:**
- 5-Day Prototype Ritual
- AI Feature Sprint
- Corporate Acceleration Audit

**Usage:** "Speed Studio clients get working prototypes in days, not months."

---

### Story & Soul Lab
**Definition:** The service pillar focused on emotional clarity, archetypes, and narrative-driven design.

**Core Services:**
- Human Story Engine
- Archetype Mapping
- Symbolic Design Sessions

**Usage:** "Story & Soul Lab is where founders discover the deeper meaning behind their work."

---

### Creative MVP School

**Focus:**
- Courses, workshops, community
- Young creatives and professionals
- Empowerment and skill-building

**Usage:** "Creative MVP School students learn to build fast and discover their creative identity."

---

### Ritual
**Definition:** A structured, intentional practice designed to create psychological safety, focus, and transformation.

**Types:**
- Morning rituals (identity, breath, focus)
- Prototype rituals (space prep, problem incantation)
- Emotional reset rituals (purge, reframe, extract)

**Usage:** "We begin each prototype session with a ritual to ground and focus."

---

### Symbolic Distance
**Definition:** The practice of using symbols and metaphors to create emotional safety when exploring difficult topics.

**Purpose:**
- Allows exploration without direct confrontation
- Creates psychological buffer
- Enables insight without overwhelm

**Usage:** "We maintain symbolic distance by asking 'what shape is this feeling?' rather than forcing direct disclosure."

---

### Functional Illusion
**Definition:** A prototype technique where complex features are simulated or hardcoded to demonstrate functionality without full implementation.

**Examples:**
- Fake backend with hardcoded data
- Wizard-of-Oz AI (human behind curtain)
- Pre-rendered "dynamic" content

**Usage:** "We'll use functional illusions to demo the AI feature before building the actual integration."

---

### Emotional Resonance Score
**Definition:** A metric measuring how deeply clients/users feel understood and aligned with the work produced.

**Measured By:**
- Client feedback
- Qualitative interviews
- Resonance surveys
- Long-term engagement

**Usage:** "We aim for a 90% emotional resonance score, meaning clients feel deeply seen and understood."

---

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Definition:** The coordination of multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to accomplish complex tasks.

**Sequence:**
1. Insight Agent → emotional truth
2. Story Architect → narrative
3. Symbol Weaver → symbols
4. Prototype Engineer → product
5. Expression Agent → aesthetic
6. Consultant Agent → validation

**Usage:** "Multi-agent orchestration allows us to maintain quality across emotional, narrative, and technical dimensions simultaneously."
