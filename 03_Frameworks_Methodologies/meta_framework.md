# Meta-Framework Integration

## Universal Cycle

The Meta-Framework combines all core methodologies into one unified process:

**Emotion → Story → Symbol → Prototype → Expression**

## How Frameworks Connect

### Story Engine → Prototype Ritual
- Story Engine extracts the emotional narrative
- Prototype Ritual builds the technical expression
- Story informs UX, features, and design decisions

### Story Engine → Creative Compass
- Both focus on identity and emotional clarity
- Story Engine provides narrative structure
- Creative Compass provides personal application

### All Three Combined
1. **Emotion** (Story Engine) - Extract the truth
2. **Story** (Story Engine) - Build the narrative
3. **Symbol** (Creative Compass) - Create visual meaning
4. **Prototype** (5-Day Ritual) - Build the product
5. **Expression** (Creative Compass) - Release and iterate

## Application Across Service Pillars

### Speed Studio
- Focuses on Prototype → Expression
- Uses Story + Symbol as foundation

### Story & Soul Lab
- Focuses on Emotion → Story → Symbol
- Prepares foundation for prototyping

### Creative MVP School
- Teaches entire cycle
- Emphasizes Expression → Emotion feedback loop

## Multi-Agent Integration
This framework guides how AI agents collaborate:
1. Insight Agent identifies **Emotion**
2. Story Architect converts to **Story**
3. Symbol Weaver creates **Symbols**
4. Prototype Engineer builds **Prototype**
5. Expression Agent polishes **Expression**

## Key Insight
Every service, product, and interaction should flow through this cycle. It's not linear—it's spiral. Each iteration deepens understanding and refines output.
