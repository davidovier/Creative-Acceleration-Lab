# 5-Day Prototype Ritual

## Framework Overview
A compressed creation cycle focused on rapid prototyping with emotional alignment.

## 5-Day Process

### Day 1: Story Extraction
- Conduct emotional anchor session
- Extract founder's core emotional driver
- Identify the "why" behind the idea
- Map pain points and desired transformation

### Day 2: Human Map
- Define key user personas
- Map emotional journey stages
- Identify universal human needs being addressed
- Create empathy and context maps

### Day 3: Technical Skeleton
- Design minimal viable architecture
- Create UX sketches
- Define data models
- Map core interactions

### Day 4: AI Layer
- Identify AI enhancement opportunities
- Select appropriate AI features
- Integrate AI functionality
- Design fallback paths

### Day 5: Delivery & Narrative
- Polish prototype
- Craft product narrative
- Create delivery presentation
- Define next steps and roadmap

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

1. Intake form review
2. Story extraction call
3. UX sketches creation
4. Technical skeleton draft
5. AI feature integration
6. Daily micro-demos
7. Final delivery ritual

## Deliverables
- Working prototype (functional or high-fidelity illusion)
- Narrative document
- User journey map
- AI feature integration
- Next steps roadmap

## Requirements
- Idea description
- Key users identification
- Pain points documentation

## Prototype Best Practices

### Principles
- Build ugly first
- Ship daily
- Hardcode everything you can
- Use AI for scaffolding
- Validate emotionally before you validate functionally
- Create functional illusions (fake backends allowed)

### Anti-Bureaucracy Rules
- No meetings longer than 25 minutes
- No documents > 1 page during prototyping
- No complex estimations
- Only build to learn — not to satisfy process

### Tools Recommended
- Low-code platforms (Mendix, Bubble, Flutterflow)
- AI model wrappers
- Diagramming tools
- Notion for exploration
- Voice notes over long-written requirements
