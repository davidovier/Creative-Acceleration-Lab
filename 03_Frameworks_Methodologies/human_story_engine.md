- Build hero's journey structure
- Create actionable story framework

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

2. Archetype matching
3. Narrative construction
4. Metaphor creation
5. Story-to-prototype mapping

## Deliverables
- Story map
- Emotional drivers documentation
- Metaphors and symbolic direction
- Narrative framework

## Story Structure for Product Narratives

### Components:
- **Hero**: who is struggling

- **Catalyst**: the founder's insight
- **Gift**: the prototype
- **Transformation**: new capability, speed, identity

## Emotional Extraction Prompts

### For Founders:
- "What problem won't leave you alone?"
- "What truth do you wish someone told you earlier?"
- "When did you last feel fully alive?"
- "What felt unfair in your last job?"

### For Deeper Work:
- "Tell me the story beneath the story"
- "Where does this live in your body?"
- "What shape feels like this feeling?"

## Founder Psychology Insights
