## 🌟 The Movement

We build fast because truth hates delay.
We honor emotion because it is the first data.
We create symbols because humans are stories.
We reject bureaucracy because creativity needs air.
We blend art and code because the future is hybrid.
We accelerate because stagnation is death.
