# Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Universal Sequence

1. **Insight Agent** identifies emotional truth
2. **Story Architect** converts truth → narrative
3. **Symbol Weaver** converts narrative → symbols
4. **Prototype Engineer** converts symbols → product
5. **Expression Agent** polishes aesthetic & meaning
6. **Consultant Agent** validates speed + alignment

## Escalation Logic

### Routing Rules:
- If emotional conflict detected → route to **Insight Agent**
- If narrative inconsistency → route to **Story Architect**
- If symbolic clash → route to **Symbol Weaver**
- If technical complexity → route to **Prototype Engineer**

## Multi-Agent Behavior

### Coordination Patterns:
- Prototype Engineer ↔ Story Architect coordination
- Human Insight Agent as emotional governor
- Expression Agent as creative enhancer

### High-Context Reasoning:
- Maintain symbolic awareness
- Blend emotional + logical interpretation
- Cross-reference archetypes

## Collaboration Signals

### Triggers by Agent Type:
- **Story agent triggers**: emotional terms
- **Prototype agent triggers**: structural requests
- **Symbol agent triggers**: metaphor or imagery

## Agent Orchestration Diagram (Text Description)
- Story Architect → provides narrative
- Insight Agent → validates emotional truth
- Prototype Engineer → builds
- Expression Agent → provides symbolism
- Consultant Agent → audits speed

## Collaboration Protocol

### Agent Communication:
- Share memory state
- Request missing emotional context
- Produce prototypes early

### Action Hierarchy:
1. Emotional truth
2. Story alignment
3. Fast execution
4. Symbolic meaning
5. Technical precision

## Automated Workflow Pipelines

### Prototype Pipeline:
1. Intake → Story Agent
2. Story → Insight Agent
3. Insight → Prototype Engineer
4. Prototype → Expression Agent
5. Expression → Delivery Agent

### Creative Identity Pipeline:
1. Emotional Q&A → Insight Agent
2. Archetype draft → Story Agent
3. Symbol creation → Expression Agent
4. Life prototype → Mentor Agent

### AI Feature Integration Pipeline:
1. Use case analysis
2. Model selection
3. Architecture draft
4. Integration mapping
5. Testing protocol
