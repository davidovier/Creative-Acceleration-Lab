# Philosophical Foundations

## Core Beliefs
- **Speed reveals truth**: fast iteration surfaces real constraints, desires, and misalignments
- **Story precedes structure**: meaning must be extracted before architecture is created
- **Emotion is data**: human feelings are valid design signals, not noise
- **Simplicity dismantles bureaucracy**: the fastest path is usually the clearest
- **Creativity is a survival mechanism**: expression leads to clarity and alignment
- **Technology is an amplifier**: it should serve human intention, not obscure it
